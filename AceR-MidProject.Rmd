## Chapter 1: Introduction of Cardiovascular Disease:

Based on The World Health Organization (WHO), Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are disorders related to the heart and blood vessels. The diseases mainly caused by fatty deposits plaque builds up on the inner walls of the blood vessels which prevent prevents blood from flowing to the heart or brain. 

![As plaque builds up in the arteries of a person with heart disease, the inside of the arteries begins to narrow, which lessens or blocks the flow of blood.](CVD picture.jpg)


According to 2016 report, cardiovascular disease remains the leading cause of death in the United States (Benjamin et al., 2019). Around 80% of CVD deaths are a heart attack and stroke. The cause of cardiovascular diseases is usually the presence of a combination of risk factors, such as unhealthy diet, obesity, physical inactivity, tobacco use and harmful use of alcohol.

Since there are many reports indicated that the cause of cardiovascular diseases is associated with our lifestyle. Therefore, we want to use this dataset to validate a person's behavior and developing of the disease.

## Chapter 2: Description of Data and Exploratory Data Analysis

### 2.1 Source Data
The source data for our EDA is a CSV containing 70 000 records of patients data in 12 features: age, height, weight, gender, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, Cholesterol, Glucose, Smoking, Alcohol intake, Physical activity, and Presence or absence of cardiovascular disease. (https://www.kaggle.com/sulianova/cardiovascular-disease-dataset)
```{r, echo=FALSE}
cardio <- read.csv("cardio_train.csv", sep = ";")
cardio$gender <- as.factor(cardio$gender)
cardio$smoke <- as.factor(cardio$smoke)
cardio$alco <- as.factor(cardio$alco)
cardio$cholesterol <- as.factor(cardio$cholesterol)
cardio$gluc <- as.factor(cardio$gluc)
cardio$active <- as.factor(cardio$active)
cardio$cardio <- as.factor(cardio$cardio)
str(cardio)
```
### 2.2 Preprocessing Data

We noticed that variable 'age' is int(day), which were converted into int(years).As height and weight individually do not mean much to patients' health, so we calculated Body Mass Index (BMI), a measure of body fat based on height and weight that applies to adult men and women, and added it as a feature. Also column 'id' was droped.
```{r, echo=F}
cardio <- subset(cardio, select=-c(id))
cardio$age <- round((cardio$age)/365)
cardio$bmi <- cardio$weight/((cardio$height/100)^2)
summary(cardio)
```

We noticed that the min value of systolic blood pressure(ap_hi) and diastolic blood pressure (ap_lo) are negative values, which do not make sense. In addition, diastolic blood pressure is supposed to be lower than systolic blood pressure. The data were further cleaned based on these crterion.

```{r, echo=F}
cardio <- cardio[which(cardio$ap_hi > 0), ]
cardio <- cardio[which(cardio$ap_lo > 0), ]
cardio <- cardio[which(cardio$ap_lo < cardio$ap_hi), ]
```

Then the distribution of age, height, weight, ap_hi and ap_lo was checked.

```{r, echo=F}
library('ggplot2')
ggplot(data=cardio, aes(x=age))+
  geom_histogram(fill="orange", col = "black", binwidth = 5)+
  ggtitle("Histogram of Age")+
  xlab("Age") + 
  ylab("Count") + 
  theme(axis.title = element_text(colour = "#7a7a78"))+
  theme(axis.text = element_text(colour = "#7a7a78"))+
  theme(plot.title= element_text(hjust=0.5, size = 14))

  theme(axis.text = element_text(colour = "#7a7a78"))+
  theme(plot.title= element_text(hjust=0.5, size = 14))
ggplot(data=cardio, aes(x=ap_hi))+
  geom_histogram(fill="blue", col = "black", binwidth = 10)+
  ggtitle("Histogram of Systolic Blood Pressure")+
  xlab("Systolic blood pressure") + 
  ylab("Count") + 
  theme(axis.title = element_text(colour = "#7a7a78"))+
  theme(axis.text = element_text(colour = "#7a7a78"))+
  theme(plot.title= element_text(hjust=0.5, size = 14))
ggplot(data=cardio, aes(x=ap_lo))+
  geom_histogram(fill="red", col = "black", binwidth = 10)+
  ggtitle("Histogram of Diastolic Blood Pressure")+
  xlab("Diastolic blood pressure") + 
  ylab("Count") + 
  theme(axis.title = element_text(colour = "#7a7a78"))+
  theme(axis.text = element_text(colour = "#7a7a78"))+
  theme(plot.title= element_text(hjust=0.5, size = 14))
```

The histogram of age shows that there are only few observation for age<35, which could not represent the population of age<35, so the observations with age<35 were droped. For height, weight, ap_hi, and ap_lo, the histograms were way skewed by some extreme outliers, which were droped in this step.

```{r outlierKD_def, include=FALSE}
# modified to allow prompt-free run-through
outlierKD <- function(dt, var, rmv=NULL) { 
     var_name <- eval(substitute(var),eval(dt))
     na1 <- sum(is.na(var_name))
     m1 <- mean(var_name, na.rm = T)
     sd1 <- sd(var_name,na.rm = T)

     #

       response <- readline(prompt="Do you want to remove outliers and to replace with NA? [yes/no]: ") 
     } else {
       if (rmv=='y'|rmv=='yes'|rmv=='Y'|rmv=='Yes'|rmv=='YES'|rmv==TRUE ) { response = 'y' } else { response = 'n' }
     }
     #

          dt[as.character(substitute(var))] <- invisible(var_name)
          assign(as.character(as.list(match.call())$dt), dt, envir = .GlobalEnv)
          cat("Outliers successfully removed", "n")
          return(invisible(dt))
     } else{
          cat("Nothing changed", "n")
          return(invisible(var_name))
     }
}
```
```{r, include=FALSE}
cardio <- cardio[which(cardio$age > 35), ]
outlierKD(cardio, height, 'y')
outlierKD(cardio, weight, 'y')
outlierKD(cardio, ap_hi, 'y')
outlierKD(cardio, ap_lo, 'y')
cardio <- na.omit(cardio)
```

The distribution of age, height, weight, ap_hi and ap_lo was checked again after outliers removed.

### Correlations among Different Variables

The correlation matrix was displayed to get an idea of the correlations among different variables.

```{r, echo=F}
library("corrplot")
ccor<-cor(cardio[c("age", "bmi", "ap_hi", "ap_lo")])
corrplot(ccor)
```


## Chapter 3: Cardio
### 3.1 SMART Question
What are the risk factors of cardiovascular diseases? Is gender, BMI, cholesterol level, glucose level, smoking, alcohol over-consumption and lack of exercise correlated to the development of cardiovascular disease?

### 3.2 Basic analyze
```{r, groupbyBMI2, echo=F}
#cardio1 <- subset(cardio, age>35)
cardio$bmiGroup <- cut(cardio$bmi, breaks = c(0, 18.5, 25, 35, 45, 55), labels = c("0", "1", "2", "3", "4"), right = FALSE)
cardio$bmiGroup <- as.factor(cardio$bmiGroup)
```

```{r groupbyAge1, echo=F}
labs <- c(paste(seq(35, 65, by = 10), seq(44, 74, by =10 ), sep = "-"))
cardio$ageGroup <- cut(cardio$age, breaks = c(seq(35, 74, by = 10), Inf), labels = labs, right = FALSE)
```

```{r, chi-test1, echo=F}
#cardio-bmi
cardio_bmi = table(cardio$bmiGroup,cardio$cardio)
chitest = chisq.test(cardio_bmi)
chitest
#cardio-glucose
cardio_glucose = table(cardio$gluc,cardio$cardio)
chitest = chisq.test(cardio_glucose)
chitest
#cardio-smoke
cardio_smoke = table(cardio$smoke,cardio$cardio)
chitest = chisq.test(cardio_smoke)
chitest
#cardio-alco
cardio_alco = table(cardio$alco,cardio$cardio)
chitest = chisq.test(cardio_alco)
chitest
#cardio-active
cardio_active = table(cardio$active,cardio$cardio)
chitest = chisq.test(cardio_active)
chitest
#cardio-age
cardio_age = table(cardio$ageGroup,cardio$cardio)
chitest = chisq.test(cardio_age)
chitest
#cardio-cholesterol
cardio_cholesterol = table(cardio$cholesterol,cardio$cardio)
chitest = chisq.test(cardio_cholesterol)
chitest
```

The null hypothesis is rejected as all p-values are small. All factors indicated above are considered to be risk factors of cardiovascular disease. 

```{r, barplot, echo=F}
ggplot(cardio,aes(x=age)) + geom_bar(aes(fill=factor(cardio)),position="fill")
```


## Chapter 4: BMI
### 4.1 SMART Question

What is the relationship between BMI and cardiovascular diseas and what factors will affect bmi? 

```{r, groupbyBMI1, echo=F}
#cardio1 <- subset(cardio, age>35)
cardio$bmiGroup <- cut(cardio$bmi, breaks = c(0, 18.5, 25, 35, 45, 55), labels = c("0", "1", "2", "3", "4"), right = FALSE)
cardio$bmiGroup <- as.factor(cardio$bmiGroup)
```

### 4.2 Is that bmi affect cardio?
```{r bmi_cardio1, echo=F}
ggplot(cardio, aes(x=bmiGroup)) + 
geom_bar(aes(fill=factor(cardio)), position="fill") + 
labs(title="Proportion of cardio per bmiGroup",x="bmiGroup", y = "proportion")
```

By comparing the BMI group with the incidence of getting cardiovascular disease, we conclude that people with higher BMI are more likely to develop cardiovascular disease. Likewise, people with cardiovascular disease are also more likely to have higher BMI.

```{r, echo=F}
cardio0 <- subset(cardio, cardio == 0)
cardio1 <- subset(cardio, cardio == 1)
cardio1$zbmi <- scale(cardio1$bmi)
```

Compare the mean and histogram between people have cardiovascular disease and not have cardiovascular disease

```{r, echo=F}
mean(cardio0$bmi, na.rm = TRUE)
mean(cardio1$bmi, na.rm = TRUE)
hist(cardio0$bmi)
hist(cardio1$bmi)
```

### 4.3 Basic analysis of BMIgroup
```{r, chi-test, echo=F}
#bmi-cardio
bmi_cardio = table(cardio$cardio,cardio$bmiGroup)
chitest = chisq.test(bmi_cardio)
chitest
#bmi-glucose
bmi_glucose = table(cardio$gluc,cardio$bmiGroup)
chitest = chisq.test(bmi_glucose)
chitest
#bmi-smoke
bmi_smoke = table(cardio$smoke,cardio$bmiGroup)
chitest = chisq.test(bmi_smoke)
chitest
#bmi-alco
bmi_alco = table(cardio$alco,cardio$bmiGroup)
chitest = chisq.test(bmi_alco)
chitest
#bmi-active
bmi_active = table(cardio$active,cardio$bmiGroup)
chitest = chisq.test(bmi_active)
chitest
```

For the glucose, cmoke, alco. The null hypothesis is rejected as all p-values are small. We conclude high BMI is moren correlated to cardiovascular disease.

Our analysis indicated that BMI level is associated with the presence of cardiovascular disease, patients with
smoke, drink alchol habits, and glucose level also associated with developing cardiovascular disease.

For active affect bmi, p-value greater than 0.05. We fail to reject H0, we can conclude that it has no impact on BMI among people who are active than people who are not active.

### 4.4 Conclusion of BMI
```{r, ttest, echo=F}
#bmi-cardio
cardio0 <- subset(cardio, cardio == 0)
cardio1 <- subset(cardio, cardio == 1)
bmitest <- t.test(cardio0$bmi,cardio1$bmi)
bmitest
boxplot(bmi ~ cardio, data = cardio, col=c("#00ff00","#ff00ff"))
#bmi-gender
women <- subset(cardio, gender == 1)
men <- subset(cardio, gender == 2)
bmitest <- t.test(women$bmi,men$bmi)
bmitest
boxplot(bmi ~ gender, data = cardio, col=c("#00ff00","#ff00ff"))
#bmi-smoke
not_smoke <- subset(cardio, smoke == 0)
smoke <- subset(cardio, smoke == 1)
bmitest <- t.test(not_smoke$bmi,smoke$bmi)
bmitest
boxplot(bmi ~ smoke, data = cardio, col=c("#00ff00","#ff00ff"))
#bmi-alco
noalco <- subset(cardio, alco == 0)
alco <- subset(cardio, alco == 1)
bmitest <- t.test(noalco$bmi,alco$bmi)
bmitest
boxplot(bmi ~ alco, data = cardio, col=c("#00ff00","#ff00ff"))
#bmi-active
noactive <- subset(cardio, active == 0)
active <- subset(cardio, active == 1)
bmitest <- t.test(noactive$bmi,active$bmi)
bmitest
boxplot(bmi ~ active, data = cardio, col=c("#00ff00","#ff00ff"))
```

We conclude that smoking, alcohol consumption, and female gender are contributed to higher BMI. In addition, the discussed characteristics has less impact on BMI among people who are active than people who are not active. 

## Chapter 5: Age
### 5.1 SMART Question

Are the mean values of different factors such as systolic blood pressure and diastolic blood pressure same across age group?

### 5.2.1 Are systolic blood pressure the same across all age group

H0: The mean values of Systolic blood pressure are the same across all agegroup.

H1: The mean values of Systolic blood pressure are different across age groups.

ANOVA and TukeyHSD are used to test the hypothesis and calculate the p-value. The diagram blow summarizes the results.


```{r groupbyAge, echo=F}
labs <- c(paste(seq(35, 65, by = 10), seq(44, 74, by =10 ), sep = "-"))
cardio$ageGroup <- cut(cardio$age, breaks = c(seq(35, 74, by = 10), Inf), labels = labs, right = FALSE)
```

```{r, echo=F}
#age-systolic blood pressure
aov <- aov(ap_hi ~ ageGroup, data = cardio)
boxplot(ap_hi ~ ageGroup, data = cardio ,main="Systolic blood pressure vs age",ylab = "Systolic blood pressure", xlab = "age", col=c("#00ff00","#ff00ff","#ff0000") )
summary(aov)
```

```{r tukeyHSD1, echo=F}
tukeyAoV <- TukeyHSD(aov)
tukeyAoV
```

Based on tukeyHSD, we conclude that people in age (65 ~74) and (45 ~54) have different systolic blood pressure. In addition, people in age (65~74) and (55~64) have different systolic blood pressure. 
The null hypothesis is rejected as all p-values are small. We conclude that the mean values of Systolic blood pressure are different across all age groups.

### 5.3 Are diastolic blood pressure the same across all age group

H0: The mean values of diastolic blood pressure are the same across all agegroup.

H1: The mean values of diastolic blood pressure are  different across age groups. 

ANOVA and TukeyHSD are used to test the hypothesis and calculate the p-value. The diagram blow summarizes the results.


```{r, echo=F}
#age - diastolic blood pressure
aov <- aov(ap_lo ~ ageGroup, data = cardio)
boxplot(ap_lo ~ ageGroup, data = cardio ,main="Diastolic blood pressure vs age",ylab = "Diastolic blood pressure", xlab = "age", col=c("#00ff00","#ff00ff","#ff0000") )
summary(aov)
```

```{r tukeyHSD, echo=F}
tukeyAoV <- TukeyHSD(aov)
tukeyAoV
```

Based on tukeyHSD, we conclude that people in age (65~74) and (45~54) have different diastolic blood pressure. In addition, people in age (65~74) and (55~64) have different diastolic blood pressure. 

The null hypothesis is rejected as all p-values are small. We conclude that the mean values of diastolic blood pressure are different across all age groups.


```{r setup, include=FALSE}

cardio3$ageGroup <- cut(cardio3$age, breaks = c(seq(35, 74, by = 10), Inf), labels = labs, right = FALSE)
```

## Chapter 6: Meacurement at Predicting Cardiovascular Disease
Being overweight or obese substantially increases your risk of developing cardiovascular disease. However, researchers don’t always agree which method is best for quantifying whether an individual is “too” overweight. So, this section will analyze if the BMI is the best meacurement at predicting risk.

### 6.1 SMART Question
Is BMI the best measurement at predicting risk in every individual? If not, is there another measurement to help to predict the risk of cardiovascular disease?

### 6.2 Cardio in Different BMI Group
To find the adult weight classification, see which of these BMI ranges the weight falls into:
```{r groupbyBMI6}
cardio3$bmiGroup <- cut(cardio3$bmi, breaks = c(0, 18.5, 25, 30, 35, 45, 50, Inf), labels = c("underWeight", "normalWeight", "overWeight", "obese", "severelyObese", "morbidlyObese", "superObese"), right = FALSE)
```

BMI  |   adult weight classification  |  
-------|-----|
[0, 18.5) kg/m^2  | underWeight | 
[18.5, 25) kg/m^2  | normalWeight | 
[25, 30) kg/m^2  | overWeight |
[30, 35) kg/m^2  | obese |
[35, 45) kg/m^2  | severelyObese |
[45, 50) kg/m^2  | morbidlyObese |
[50, Inf) kg/m^2  | superObese |

```{r bmi_cardio6}
ggplot(data=cardio3, mapping=aes(x=bmiGroup,fill=factor(cardio)))+
geom_bar(stat="count",width=0.5,position='fill')+
scale_fill_manual(values=c('#E5E7E9','#E74C3C'))+
theme_minimal()+
labs(title="Proportion of cardio per bmiGroup",x="BMI Group", y = "proportion")+
theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle=90, hjust=1)) 
```


The bar chart pressents the incidence of cardiovascular disease in groups of different BMI levels. From the figure we can see that before the severelyObese level, as the BMI parameter continues to increase, the incidence of cardiovascular disease gradually increases. When the BMI level exceeds severelyObese level, the morbidity rate tends to be stable and has a slow downward trend. 
However, BMI is not always accurate in every individual. It overestimates body fat in people with a lot of muscle mass and tends to underestimate it in elderly people. So, the idea of using waist circumference as a risk predictor stems from the fact comes up.

### 6.3 Predicted Waist Circumference by BMI

Carrying excess body fat around your middle is more of a health risk than if weight is on your hips and thighs. In that case, waist circumference is a better estimate of visceral fat, the dangerous internal fat that coats the organs.

An initial model expressed the regression of WC on BMI in the following form:

WCi = b0 + b1BMIi + b2AGEi + b3BLACKi + b4HISPi + ei

where i indexes individuals, WCi is waist circumference for individual i, BMIi is body mass index, AGEi is current age (in years), BLACKi is an indicator for African-American, HISPi is an indicator for Hispanic ethnicity, and ei is the residual.

For women the pattern was better summarized by using one constant for age<35years and a separate intercept and slope for age≥35years. Thus, the model for women was

WCi = c0 + c1BMIi + c2I{AGEi ≥ 35} + c3AGEi × I{AGEi ≥ 35} + c4BLACKi + c5HISPi + ei

where I{B} is an indicator function: I{B} = 1 when B is true and 0 otherwise.

After the prediction, the sample of the data is as follows:
```{r predict_waist}
predicted_men_waist <- function(bmi, age){
    b0 = 22.61306
    b1BMI = 2.520738*(bmi)
    b2AGE = 0.1583812*(age)
    return (b0 + b1BMI + b2AGE)
}

predicted_women_waist <- function(bmi, age){
    c0 = 28.81919
    c1BMI = 2.218007*(bmi)
    age_35 = 1
    c2IAGE35 = -3.688953 * age_35
    IAGE35 = -0.6570163 * age_35
    c3AGEi = 0.125975*(age)
    return (c0 + c1BMI + c2IAGE35 + IAGE35 + c3AGEi)
}

predicted_waist <- function(gender, bmi, age){
    ifelse(gender == 2, predicted_men_waist(bmi, age), predicted_women_waist(bmi, age))
}

cardio3$predict_waist <- predicted_waist(cardio3$gender, cardio3$bmi, cardio3$age)

head(cardio3[c("gender", "bmi", "predict_waist")], 5)
```

### 6.4 Cut Off Line and Obese

Studies have shown that a waist circumference of 95cm or more in men, and of 88cm or more in women, is associated with elevated cardiovascular risk. So, we use these parameters as cuf off line for each gender.

A Body Mass Index of 25kg/m^2 or more is defined as obese, which means the risk of having cardiovascular disease is higher. 

At the same time, two parameters are defined here: "safe area" and "warning area". When both waist circumference and BMI parameters are lower than the cut off line and obese parameters, the result is safe area, otherwise the result is warnning area.

The statistical results of cardiovascular disease after cut off and obese classification are as follows:
```{r bmi cut_off}
obesed <- function(bmi){
  ifelse(bmi < 25, "normal weight", "obese")
}

From the three safe/warning area vs cardiovascular disease bar plots, the risk of having cardiovascular disease in all genders is 15.4% if he/she is in safe area, and 34% if he/she is in warning area. In only women section, the risk of having cardiovascular disease is 14.9% if she is in safe area, and 34.7% if she is in warning area. In only men section, the risk of having cardiovascular disease is 16.4% if he is in safe area, and 32.6% if he is in warning area.

### 6.6 Conclusion
* From the three different measurements above (Cut Off Line vs Cardiovascular Disease; Obese vs Cardiovascular Disease; Cut Off Line + Obese vs Cardiovascular Disease), we could see that all of the three measurements work well to help people predict the risk of cardiovascular disease. However, the Cut Off Line + Obese vs Cardiovascular Disease measurement method performs best. 
* If you just have your weight and height data and want to predict the disease in an easy way, you can just use them to calculate the BMI value, and use the Obese vs Cardiovascular Disease measurement.
* If you want to predict the risk in a more accurate result, you can also measure your waist circumference while measuring your height and weight.



## Chapter 7: Conclusion and Discussion

In summary, our analysis indicated that BMI level and smoking are associated with the risk of cardiovascular diseases. Moreover, age, gender, smoking, blood glucose level, and alcohol use have an impact on BMI level. 

We further subgroup the BMI value into weight classes cataloged by NIH. The plot showed that higher BMI values tend to have an increased risk of cardiovascular disease. Another way to measure in Cardiovascular disease risk is through waist circumference (WC). Abdominal obesity is a well-researched risk factor for CVD and is being suggested to be used in adjunct with BMI to determine a person's CVD risk. We further predict WC value using a specific formula and set the parameter for plotting (Bozeman et al., 2012), our result indicated that WC value is also a good variable for predicting cardiovascular diseases. 

There are many risk factors in Cardiovascular diseases, studies suggested that the genetic variances in patients have an impact on the development of the diseases. Furthermore, a persons’ family with cardiovascular diseases also increased their risk (Kathiresan & Srivastava, 2012). According to Harvard Health Publishing, the rates of high blood pressure, diabetes, and heart disease vary among people of different races and living countries. Therefore, the dataset could include patients’ family background, race, and ethnicity as additional variables for analyzing cardiovascular diseases.

More deeper to analyze the cardio, because of gender, cholesterol, glucose level, smoking, alcohol over-consumption and active level are all categrocial on the raw dataset.. On the next project, we will use logesitic function to analyze the relation between bmi (as numercial) with the other risk factor. On this project, we divide bmi as 5 groups, every 10 level as one group. Also for the age, we divided 10 as one group for each. For next project, we will use age as numerical data to perform 2-sample t-test.

We know that BMI have higher corelation with cardio diseaseas, we want know what will be risk factors to affect BMI. It will also have affect to cardio diseases. For the bmiGroup, it is also same like chapter3, we divide it to five group. It is better to us use chi-square to test it. Our conclusion is that people have cardio diseases, female people, smoking, drinking alco and do active will more developing BMI number. For the chapter4.2, we know that people who have higher bmi are older people. We can conclude that people have higher BMI will develop cardio disease. Also, we can conclude that people who have pervious bad habit will develop the cardio diseases. On the next project, we will more focus on cardio diseases.
